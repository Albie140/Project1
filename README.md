# Recipe Roulette

Recipe Roulette is a recipe generating app created for anyone who has a general idea of a food they would like to eat. The user enters a food item clicks search then the app returns a meal recipe containing that food and a cocktail. Our goal was to create a user interface that is sleek, modern, and aesthetically pleasing. We used the Framework UI Kit as well as the Work Sans Google Font to achieve this goal. 

Designed for those who are looking to try something completely new for any meal of the day!
