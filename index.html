<!-- HAPPY CODING :)  -->

<!-- Pseudo code for HTML  -->
<!-- Step 1: our web layout  -->
<!-- navbar: for tiltle in the header -->
<!-- two search bar: one for meals and one for drinks -->
<!-- search bar with the same form and each have their own submit button -->
<!-- icebox feature : potentially add a random feature for reciepes -->
<!-- two cards created for meal and drinks search results, maybe add picture, titles -->
<!-- card could be existed initially or visisble upon search -->
<!-- Features: CSS, Bootstrap(maybe), APIs images, icebox feature, . -->
<!-- finally get reciepes and results -->














<!-- Ideally, how would it be?  -->
<!-- - initial landing page with get started option to jump to the next thing -->
<!-- - localStorage would have been used! (go above and beyone yaay!) -->
