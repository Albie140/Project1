<!-- two search bar: one for meals and one for drinks -->
<!-- search bar with the same form and each have their own submit button -->
<!-- icebox feature : potentially add a random feature for reciepes -->
<!-- two cards created for meal and drinks search results, maybe add picture, titles -->
<!-- card could be existed initially or visisble upon search -->
<!-- Features: CSS, Bootstrap(maybe), APIs images, icebox feature, . -->
